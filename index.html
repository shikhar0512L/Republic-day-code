        Republic Day is a national holiday in India, when the country marks and celebrates the date on which the
        Constitution of India came into effect on 26, January 1950, replacing the Government of India Act (1935) as the
        governing document of India and thus, turning the nation into a newly formed republic.The day also marks the
        transition of India from an autonomous Commonwealth realm with British Monarch as nominal head of the Indian
        Dominion, to a fully sovereign republic in the Commonwealth of Nations with the President of India as the
        nominal head of the Indian Union.

        The Constitution was adopted by the Indian Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949 and came into effect on 26
        January 1950 with a democratic government system, completing the country's transition towards becoming an
        independent republic. 26 January was chosen as the date for Republic day because it was on this day in 1930 when
        the Declaration of Indian Independence (Purna Swaraj) was proclaimed by the Indian National Congress in lieu of
        the Realm status as a Dominion later instated by the departing British Regime.

        India achieved independence from British Raj on 15 August 1947 following the Indian independence movement. The
        independence came through the Indian Independence Act 1947, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that
        partitioned British India into the two new independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth (later Commonwealth
        of Nations).India obtained its independence on 15 August 1947 as a constitutional monarchy with George VI as
        head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general. The country, though, did not yet have a permanent
        constitution; instead its laws were based on the modified colonial Government of India Act 1935. On 29 August
        1947, a resolution was moved for the appointment of Drafting Committee, which was appointed to draft a permanent
        constitution, with Dr B R Ambedkar as chairman. While India's Independence Day celebrates its freedom from
        British Rule, the Republic Day celebrates the coming into force of its constitution. A draft constitution was
        prepared by the committee and submitted to the Constituent Assembly on 4 November 1947.The Assembly met, in
        sessions open to public, for 166 days, spread over a period of two years, 11 months and 18 days before adopting
        the Constitution. After many deliberations and some modifications, the 308 members of the Assembly signed two
        hand-written copies of the document (one each in Hindi and English) on 24 January 1950.Two days later which was
        on 26 January 1950, it came into effect throughout the whole nation. On that day, Dr. Rajendra Prasad's began
        his first term of office as President of the Indian Union. The Constituent Assembly became the Parliament of
        India under the transitional provisions of the new Constitution.On the eve of Republic Day, the President
        addresses the nation.
